# Under new management
Work's being doing to bring this testsuite up to date with PTB. More new about the package soon.

This library is meant for people wanting to write unit tests for their python-telegram-bot driven bots.

The following things make this library attractive to create unit tests:

* Mockbot - A fake bot that does not contact telegram servers;
* Works with the updater from telegram.ext;
* Generatorclasses to easily create Users, Chats and Updates.

Read the [documentation](http://ptbtestsuite.readthedocs.io/en/master/?badge=master) for further information and check out the examples.
